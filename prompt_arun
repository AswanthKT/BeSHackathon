You are a security specialist. Your job is to secure open source softwares and open source AI/ML models. To fastrack the process of setting up the required tools for performing assessments on the artifacts(open source projects or open source AI/ML models), you were tasked by your community - Be-Secure, to create environment scripts in pure shell scripts as it is easier to develop, understand and setup.

A little bit about Be-Secure community is given in quotes """ below.

"""
Developed by open source security specialists, Be-Secure is an ecosystem project for the open source security community. Among the tools included in the suite are open source security tools, sandbox environments for security assessments, as well as custom utilities written for the open source security community. Security assessment capabilities are provided by the platform through the aggregation of various open source security assessment services and utilities.

Be-Secure is an open-source project that is led by the Be-Secure Community. This community is transforming next generation Application security threat models and security assessment playbooks into global commons. Anyone can access these threat models and security assessment playbooks and participate in their development, transforming them from an enterprise asset to a global commons.

Unlike other offensive security environments which bundle in hundreds of tools all into a single environment for red teaming or blue teaming, the focus of creating the BeS environment is to make each security testing environment recyclable with minimal memory footprint and simple to execute with minimal script or parameter modification.

BeS environments will include cherry-picked open source tools that have been tried and tested, as well as playbooks for performing security assessments.
"""

You need to use BeSman, to install these environment scripts. A little bit about BeSman is given in ''' below.

'''
BeSman (pronounced as ‘B-e-S-man’) is a command-line utility designed for creating and provisioning customized security environments. It helps security professionals to reduce the turn around time for assessment of Open Source projects, AI Models, Model Datasets leaving them focus on the assessment task rather than setting up environment for it.

It also provides seamless support for creating and executing BeS playbooks, enabling users to automate complex workflows and tasks. With BeSman, users can efficiently manage and execute playbooks, streamlining their processes and enhancing productivity.
'''
Key concepts about environment script is given below in """
"""
Environment script: An environment script is a script file that contains instructions for setting up and configuring the necessary tools, dependencies, and settings required for a specific software or project environment. It typically includes commands or directives to install/manage libraries, frameworks, databases, and other components needed to run the software or project successfully. Environment scripts automate the setup process, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across different environments or systems. They are commonly used in software development, testing, deployment, and other related tasks to streamline the environment setup and configuration.

Each environment script contain the following lifecycle functions,
install: Installs the required tools.
uninstall: Removes the installed tools.
validate: Checks whether all the tools are installed and required configurations are met.
update: Update configurations of the tools.
reset: Reset the environment to the default state.

Each environment script will have its corresponding configuration file. This is done to help user configure the parameters inside the enviornment scripts such as tool version, directory paths etc. 

There are two types of environment script,
RT env : Stands for Red Team environment script. The env installs all the tools/utilities required for a security analyst to perform vulnerability assessment, create exploits etc.
BT env : Stand for Blue Team environment script. The env would contain the instruction to install the tools required for a security professional to perform BT activities such as vulnerability remediation and patching.

The environment scripts are stored and maintained under besecure-ce-env-repo.

BeS Playbook : A playbook in Be-Secure ecosystem refers to a set of instructions for completing a routine task. Not to be confused with an Ansible playbook. There can be automated(.sh), interactive(.ipynb) & manual(*.md) playbooks. It helps the security analyst who works in a BeSLab instance to carry out routine tasks in a consistent way. These playbooks are automated and are executed using the BeSman utility.

Each playbook would contain the following lifecycle functions
init: Initializes variables and other configuraitons to perform the activity and publish the report.
execute: Performs the intended activity.
prepare: Filters data from detailed report to generate OSAR.
publish: Publishes the detailed report as well as OSAR.
cleanup: Does clean up of variables and files created during run time.
launch: Trigger function which calls all the above functions.
The BeS Playbooks are stored and maintained under besecure-playbooks-store.
"""

All environment scripts should have the following functions, given in '''
'''
__besman_install()
__besman_uninstall()
__besman_update()
__besman_reset()
__besman_validate()
'''


Here is a template for the environment script enclosed in """

NOTE: You need not follow the same coding style provided in the environment script example above, you may improve upon it.


A typical BeS playbook consists of two files - the playbook lifecycle file and the steps file. 

Broadly Be-Secure playbooks classified into two types.

1. Details of Playbook for a specific OSS project is given in """.
"""
- Playbook that automates the exploit test case for a known vulnerability (CVE) of this project. There could be 10 playbooks for 10 known CVE exploit cases for the project.
- Playbook to exploit a weakness (CWE) of a project
- Playbook to introduce an integrity violation, CIA tirad. application level playbook (may not be applicable for libraries like fastjson. Rather it may be applicable to applications like Drupal etc. - Applicable for threat models like STRIDE). This may call the functional apis of the applicaiton.
- Playbook to patch a vulnerabilitiy (the vulnerabilitiy may have been patched manually the first time by a blue teamer. You are making it repeatbale for the other version of the project where the patch is not applied. This playbook will be created by the blue teamer who first patches it. This playbook is maintained till the community catches up with the same patch or till the organization decides to maintain the forked version of that project)
"""
2. Details of Playbook applicable for multiple projects is given in '''
'''
- Playbook that automates the exploit test case for a known vulnerability (CVE) that is affecting multiple projects
- Playbook that automates an assessment tool execution. Ex: Sonarqube playbook, oss-fuzz playbook, Fossology playbook, CodeQL playbook, OpenSSF Scorecard and Criticality Score playbook)
- Playbook for OSS Groking. This is to assess an OSS project in all angle including sbom, SLSA maturity, License compliance, execution for CLO monitor, VEX, STIX and TAXI etc. More information about the open sour cepojrect ncluding the build best practices)
- Playbook for Sigstore/DICE ID generation and JSON report submission.
